# The Complete Minecraft Server Guide
Hello and welcome to the final guide any beginner will need to be able to set up their very own Minecraft server. This guide is in its very beginning stages of life so expect a lot of missing content and constantly changing information.

# The Goal
The overall goal of this projhect is to create an up-to-date guide that is as easy as possible to follow and allows near-beginners with little to no networking or computer knowledge to be able to create a complete Minecraft server. I know...ambitious.
